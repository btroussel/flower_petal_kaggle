# Petals to the Metal - Kaggle competition

Welcome to my notebook on the Petals to the metal Kaggle Competition !

I achieved through this notebook to obtain an accuracy of 0.96214 using the ViT (Vision Transformer model) or the BEiT model with the HuggingFace "transformer" Library. I only use images of size 331x331 because of memory issues on my macbook, but feel free to test it with higher resolution images that will certainly give better results. I don't provide any way to use TPUs on Kaggle.

This notebook provides images from the competion under the "jpeg format" that are more suitable for a training using Pytorch. Some CSVs are provided listing the path for every image and its label.

Example of dataset for JPEG images : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msheriey/104-flowers-garden-of-eden

Enjoy exploring this notebook!
